### Summary
 I have just started learning Front-End Development. It became interesting to me from the first line of code. I study hard and learn new materials fast. Also, I love active sport and have won a few competitions on speedcubing. I think, it even helps me in my studying since speedcubing and coding are similar at some point - you learn the scheme (technic), you practice a lot and master it. In result you become a professional (winner). The practice is important, during it you improve your logic. Even if it takes a lot of time the knowledge you get are much more important from the time youâ€™ve spent. So, my point is that only a lot of practice and hard studying is a key to success.
